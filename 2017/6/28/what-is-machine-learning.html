        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <span class="date">June 28, 2017</span>
        <p>If you've kept up to date with any of the latest announcements from tech giants like Google and Amazon or read about technological advancements made in industries such as finance and health, you have no doubt heard the term "machine learning" tossed around. But while it is easy enough to see that machine learning has drastically improved lots of services and products, how has it actually done that? In other words, what is machine learning and how does it work? If you're not sure about the answers to these two questions, don't worry because this is exactly what we'll be discussing in this and several future posts! Let's begin with an introduction to machine learning.</p>
        <p>There are lots of problems, such as recognizing handwritten digits or identifying spam, for which it is too difficult to write an explicit computer program that always outputs the correct answer. This is primaril due to the variability of the data, as there are no specific rules that dictate whether the following digit is a zero or a six or if an email should be tagged as spam or not.</p>
