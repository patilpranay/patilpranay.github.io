        <span class="title">What is Machine Learning?</span>
        <span class="date">June 28, 2017</span>
        <p>If you've kept up to date with any of the latest announcements from
        tech giants like Google and Amazon or read about technological
        advancements made in industries such as finance and health, you have no
        doubt heard the term "machine learning" tossed around. But while it is
        easy enough to see that machine learning has drastically improved lots
        of services and products, how has it actually done that? In other
        words, what is machine learning and how does it work? If you're not
        sure about the answers to either of these two questions, don't worry
        because this is exactly what we'll be discussing in this and several
        future posts! Let's begin with an introduction to machine learning.</p>
        <p>There are lots of problems, such as recognizing handwritten digits
        or identifying spam, for which it is too difficult to write an explicit
        computer program that always outputs the correct answer. This is
        primarily due to the variability of the data, as there are no specific
        rules that dictate whether the following digit is a zero or a six or if
        an email should be tagged as spam or not.</p>
        <img

          style="max-width:40%;height:auto;"
        >
        <h6>A handwritten digit that could be a six or a zero</h6>
        <p>For this reason, we build models that learn by looking at lots and
        lots of examples and their correct answers. Then, when the model comes
        across a particular example that it has not seen before, it uses what
        it has learned to output a prediction for this new example.</p>
        <p>The field of machine learning is concerned with the study of these
        types of models and what strategies and algorithms to use to build the
        best model, i.e., one that minimizes the number of incorrect
        predictions for unseen examples.</p>
        <h3>Formulation</h3>
        <p>We can formally state the problem described above as follows. Given
        $\{x_i,y_i\}$ for $i=1\dots n$, we want to build a model $f$ such that
        we minimize $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\|y_i-f(x_i)\|^{2}.$$ Let us break down
        this statement and understand what it is saying. $\{x_i,y_i\}$
        indicates a set of <b>training data</b> of size $n$, where the $x_i$
        are the examples and the $y_i$ are the labels (or correct answers) of
        these examples.</p>
        <p>$f$ represents a model (which can be thought of as a function) that,
        given an input $x_i$, outputs a prediction $f(x_i)$.</p>
        <p>Since we don't know the correct answers to any unseen data, the only
        way we can judge how well our model works is to compare the predictions
        output by the model for the training examples against their actual
        labels. We want the difference between the label and the predicted
        answer to be as small as possible, i.e., we want to minimize
        $y_i-f(x_i)$. We take the squared $l_2$ norm of this value to discard
        the effect of negatives, resulting in $\|y_i-f(x_i)\|^2$. This as known
        as the <b>error</b> of the model for example $x_i$.</p>
        <p>Since we want to measure how well the model predicts against all of
        the training examples, we calculate the error of the model for all the
        examples and sum up the results, giving us
        $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\|y_i-f(x_i)\|^{2}.$$ This is known as the <b>squared
        error loss</b> and is one way to measure the quality of a model.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Now that we know what exactly a machine learning model is and how to
        quantify its effectiveness, let us take a closer look at the input to
        such a model, i.e., the training data.</p>
        <p>As described above, the training data consists of training examples
        (the $x_i$) and their corresponding labels (the $y_i$). However, while
        it is simple to numerically represent a label, with $y=7$ indicating a
        handwritten '7', it is not as obvious how to do so for the actual
        training example itself. How do you numerically represent an image of a
        handwritten digit?</p>
        <p>To do so, we must extract <b>features</b>, measurable properties of
        an object, from the image. In this case, a potential choice of features
        would be the values of each of the pixels of the image.</p>
        <p>Once the features are chosen, they are encoded as a $d$-dimensional
        vector where $d$ is the number of features. In the case of a 28x28
        image, $d$ would be the number of pixels, or 784. Thus, the $x_i$ that
        we have up until this point used to represent the training examples are
        actually all $d$-dimensional vectors where the components of $x_i$ are
        the values of the features of example $i$.</p>
        <h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges to building an effective machine
        learning model is choosing which features of the training examples to
        use to train (or build) the model. Just feeding raw data to the model
        usually does not work and so the performance of many models is
        dependent on how insightful the programmer is in choosing the
        features.</p>
        <p>Certain machine learning algorithms like <b>neural networks</b>
        (another buzz word you may have heard tossed around at technology
        conferences) are popular because they are able to learn by themselves
        which features to focus on, thus moving the problem of feature
        extraction from the programmer to the computer.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a term used to describe models that memorize, or
        learn, important features from numerous examples and then use that
        knowledge to try to accurately classify new data that these models have
        not seen before. In this post, we developed a mathematical formulation
        for a machine learning model, including how input data is provided to
        the model and how the effectiveness of a model is calculated.</p>
        <p>At this point, however, you may find yourself asking, "I understand
        <i>what</i> a model does, but <i>how</i> does it do it?" This is a
        perfectly valid question and we'll answer it in the next post when we
        take a look at one of the most popular machine learning models used in
        industry today: the neural network.</p>
